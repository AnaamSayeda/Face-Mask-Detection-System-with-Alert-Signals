## 📣 Introduction
Wearing Face Masks has become a new norm in our daily lives, without which we cannot enter any public places. This system detects whether a person is wearing a face mask or not. The system is built using Python, OpenCV and Keras with TensorFlow. On detection of a person without a mask,the system creates an alarm and shows pop warning message to the violator.
